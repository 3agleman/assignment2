        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> This paper is about data tidying, a method for cleaning data that involves manipulating datasets so that each variable has a column and each observation has a row. It then goes on to explain that this is a way to make cleaning data easy and consistent, mentioning a case study where this will be demonstrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to simplify the initial cleaning of data so that you can use one simple procedure each time you encounter a new dataset, helping you spend less time on figuring out how to clean your data and more time actually interepreting and transforming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> The first sentence means that all tidied datasets are similar in that they all follow the same format (columns to variables, rows to observations, etc.). The second sentence means that it's easy to define which things are observations and which are variables (based on 2.2, which says that \"...it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables, and easier to make comparisons between groups of observations\"(Tidy Data, pg. 4)) - the second clause means that it's harder to come up with a general definition for these terms because the first method of reasoning relies on looking at whatever dataset you're working with and then making your decision from there.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> As defined here, values are (typically) individual numbers or strings, variables contain all values that correspond to the same underlying unit across all observations, while observations are made up of all the values measured for a particular unit across all the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> \"Tidy Data\" is defined here as data in which every variable forms a column, every observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> The five most common problems with messy datasets are column headers being values instead of variable names, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables being stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units being stored in one table, and a single observational unit being distributed among multiple tables. The data in table 4 is messy because one variable (income) is distributed among multiple columns, i.e. that the column headers are values (of income) instead of variable names. \"Melting\" a dataset is defined here as turning columns into rows by \"stacking\" the data - for example, the columns here (the income levels) are \"melted\" down into one variable - \"Income\", with the individual observations becoming their own values attached to each religion and frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> Table 11 is messy because the variables in it are stored in both rows and columns - for example, what could go into a potential \"date\" variable is spread out among multiple columns (d1, d2, d3, etc.), while \"tmax\" and \"tmin\" should each have their own column but are instead stored in the rows. Table 12(a), on the other hand, is molten because it has consolidated the \"day\" variable into one column under date, while 12(b) goes further to tidy the data by giving \"tmax\" and \"tmin\" their own columns, as mentioned before.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem mentioned here is that \"if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will inextricably be linked to tidy data\" (Tidy Data, pg. 20). The author hopes that, in the future, other common challenges such as dealing with typos, identifying missing values, and correcting character encodings can be overcome through further development of frameworks like data tidying.\n",
